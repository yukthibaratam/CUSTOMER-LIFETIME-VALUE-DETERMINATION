# CUSTOMER-LIFETIME-VALUE-DETERMINATION

The Beta-Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BG-NBD) model is an influential probabilistic model for describing customer behavior and for predicting customer lifetime value (CLV).

The lifetimes Python library, developed by Cam-Davidson Pillon, is used in this study. Lifetimes abstracts away the internal complexity of BG-NBD and allows us to focus on deriving insights and business values out of the model.
